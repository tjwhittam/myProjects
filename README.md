  Reset is when your hero card skill values are accumulated into your pool
  Upkeep is when static abilities take place (not implemented)
  Draw is when you draw your card for the turn
  Action is when you can play cards; hero cards go on the board, and skill cards let you interact with game elements.
  End is when end conditions are met:

    Condition 2: A player has no heroes on the board.
